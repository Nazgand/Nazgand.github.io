        <h2>Gandteke</h2>
        <p>
            In highschool, I developed a RuneScape 2 private server named Gandteke written in Java.
            Gandteke had cuss censoring code that would turn anyone who cussed into a frog.
            I found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200506185325/https://www.rune-server.ee/runescape-development/rs2-server/214555-best-server-all-time-your-opinions-needed-32.html">an endorsement for Gandteke</a>>.
            During development, I did not use version control or backups, which led to the end of the project when I introduced bugs I was unable to fix.
            The Gandteke source code is lost.

        <h2>TBA Cheat client</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081221062341/http://www.tbadventure.com/">TBAdventure</a> (TBA for short) was a flash game made by Attilio Infante.
            Here is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090214000346/http://tbadventure.com:80/statistics.php">the last snapshot of the highscores</a>.
            My account was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090217044641/http://tbadventure.com/stats.php?id=Nazgand">Nazgand</a>
            Description at <a href="https://tbadventure.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page">TBAdventure Wiki</a>.
            I volunteered as a security consultant on the supposedly secret TBA admin forum.
            I used javascript to send people's login details to my website, which logged the data. This happened first in the TBA forums until Attilio Infante stopped allowing javascript in the TBA forums, after which I replicated the bug with javascript injection for anyone who viewed my website.
            The TBA cheat client source code is lost.
        </p>
        My TBA cheat client could:
        <ul>
            <li>Teleport to any map</li>
            <li>Use a modular arithmetic error to add a total of 2^32=4294967296 stat points to the combat stats.</li>
            <li>Create gold through a trading glitch.</li>
            <li>Repeatedly teleport to a boss (which was not yet available to regular players), kill it, and loot it. A server-wide message appeared every time the boss was killed, which happened multiple times per second.</li>
            <li>Auto-loot bones and Auto-bury bones. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200506194408/https://tbadventure.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_burying">My account(Nazgand) was the best burier in the game.</a></li>
        </ul>
